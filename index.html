                    Lucky Shrub was started by a couple, Jason and Maria, who
                    share a long-time love for plants. Jason is the garden
                    architect. He creates and oversees all designs while
                    managing his team of landscapers. Maria manages all the
                    marketing for the company and oversees the nursery. We help
                    designing, creating and maintaining beautiful landscapes.
